On December 3, 2025, the React team disclosed a **critical security vulnerability** affecting applications using React Server Components (RSC). This is one of the most serious vulnerabilities ever found in the React ecosystem.

## The Problem

An unauthenticated attacker can craft a malicious HTTP request to any Server Function endpoint that, when deserialized by React, **achieves remote code execution (RCE) on the server**.

This means an attacker could potentially:
- Execute arbitrary commands on your server
- Access sensitive data
- Compromise the entire application

## Are You Affected?

Your application is **NOT affected** if:
- Your React code doesn't use a server
- You don't use a framework or bundler that supports React Server Components

Your application **IS affected** if you use:
- Next.js
- React Router (with RSC)
- Waku
- @parcel/rsc
- @vitejs/plugin-rsc
- Redwood SDK (rwsdk)

## Immediate Action

Update to one of the fixed versions:

- **React 19.0.1**
- **React 19.1.2**
- **React 19.2.1**

### For Next.js

```bash
npm install next@latest
```

### For React Router

```bash
npm install react-router@latest
```
