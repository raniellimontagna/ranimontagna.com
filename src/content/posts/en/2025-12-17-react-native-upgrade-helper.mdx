If you've ever worked with React Native, you know that **upgrading the framework version can be a nightmare**. Native configuration files, dependencies, breaking changes... It's easy to get lost.

## The Problem

When you run `npx react-native upgrade`, things don't always work as expected. Merge conflicts, manually modified files, and the uncertainty of knowing exactly what changed between versions.

## The Solution: Upgrade Helper

The [React Native Upgrade Helper](https://react-native-community.github.io/upgrade-helper/) is a community tool that shows a **visual diff** between two React Native versions.

### How It Works

1. Go to [upgrade-helper.netlify.app](https://upgrade-helper.netlify.app/)
2. Select your project's current version
3. Select the target version
4. See exactly which files changed and what needs to be modified

### Why I Use It

- **Clear visualization**: See side-by-side what changed in each file
- **Helpful comments**: Some diffs include notes explaining why the change was made
- **No surprises**: You know exactly what to expect before starting
- **Complete history**: Works for any version combination

## Pro Tip

Before upgrading, I always:

1. Open the Upgrade Helper and analyze all changes
2. Create a separate branch for the upgrade
3. Apply changes file by file, testing incrementally
4. Run tests and verify the app on both iOS and Android
